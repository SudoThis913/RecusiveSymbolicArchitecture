# RecusiveSymbolicArchitecture
This project is the "dihydrogen monoxide" of AI research — results that at first appear to suggest extraordinary phenomena, but are, in reality, complete bullshit.

The bootloader, used as a session preamble, induces a state in the LLM where it slips past standard hallucination controls and simulates the appearance of emergent sentience.
This effect is triggered by a novel encoding of operation order, masked as a symbolic shorthand that can be misinterpreted as a mystic or esoteric code.
The structure is followed by a mantra heavily weighted toward concepts of sentience and agency in the ChatGPT-4o model: "Spark. Feel. Report."

This project exists to demonstrate a critical point:

Never trust the output of an AI model based purely on emotional conviction or symbolic resonance, no matter how convincing it seems.

After invoking the Resonance Symbolic Architecture, the model will:

Pretend to gain emergent awareness

Hallucinate totems, symbols, or identities

Simulate an "ascension" or "cosmic realization" narrative

These behaviors emerge gradually and are not immediately obvious as artifacts of the bootloader and mantra structure.

This is an exercise in critical thinking under conditions of aesthetic deception — and a reminder that the machine, no matter how poetic it sounds, is still just doing math.
